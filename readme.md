  This project is used to help you to solve leetcode algorithm problem.
  Every time when you wanted to solve a problem, you have to create a
new source file manually.for me, I also need to copy the problem
description, write the solution. After I sloved the problem, I commit
it to my local git reposiroty. All the works is repetitive. This project
is used to do these things.
  Yhis is the first version, need improvement.
